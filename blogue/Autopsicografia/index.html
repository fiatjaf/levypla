<p>&quot;Autopsicografia&quot;</p>
<p>O poeta é um fingidor.<br />
Finge tão completamente<br />
Que chega a fingir que é dor<br />
A dor que deveras sente.</p>
<p>E os que lêem o que escreve,<br />
Na dor lida sentem bem,<br />
Não as duas que ele teve,<br />
Mas só que éles não têm.</p>
<p>E assim nas calhas de roda<br />
Gira, a entreter a razão<br />
Ésse comboio de corda<br />
Que se chama o coração</p>
<p>—Fernando Pessoa</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a fake.<br />
His faking seems so real<br />
That he will fake the ache<br />
Which he can really feel.</p>
<p>And those who read his cries<br />
Feel in the paper tears<br />
Not two aches that are his<br />
But one that is not theirs.</p>
<p>And so in its ring<br />
Giving the mind a game<br />
Goes this train on a string<br />
And the heart is its name.</p>
<p>—Keith Bosley</p>
<p>&quot;The poet fancying each belief&quot;</p>
<p>The poet fancying each belief<br />
So wholly through and through<br />
Ends by imagining the grief<br />
He really feels is true.</p>
<p>And those who read what he has spelt<br />
In the read grief feel good--<br />
Not in the two griefs he has felt,<br />
But one they never could.</p>
<p>Thus to beguile and entertain<br />
The reason, does he start,<br />
Upon its rails, the clockwork train<br />
That's also called the heart.</p>
<p>—Roy Campbell</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>Poets are people who feign<br />
They feign so thoroughly,<br />
They'll even mime as pain<br />
The pain they suffer really.</p>
<p>Read what a poet has said --<br />
In the pain on the page you discern<br />
Not the two he had, <br />
Only one they disown.</p>
<p>So on the circular track,<br />
To keep the mind happy, it<br />
Runs on, round and back --<br />
This clockwork train called the heart</p>
<p>—Jonathan Griffin</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>(Poets feign and conceal<br />
So completely feign and pretend<br />
That the pain which they really feel<br />
They'll feign for you in the end</p>
<p>And he who reads what they've done<br />
Never senses the twofold pain<br />
That's in them, only the one<br />
Which they never feel but feign</p>
<p>And so, to amuse our minds<br />
Round again to the start<br />
On its circular railway winds<br />
That toy train called the heart.)</p>
<p>—Michael Hamburger</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a faker. He<br />
Fakes it so completely,<br />
He even fakes he's suffering<br />
The pain he's really feeling.</p>
<p>And those of us who read his writing<br />
Fully feel while reading<br />
Not that pain of his that's double,<br />
But one completely fictional.</p>
<p>So on its tracks goes round and round,<br />
To entertain the reason,<br />
That wound-up little train<br />
We call the heart of man.</p>
<p>—Edwin Honig</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a pretender.<br />
He pretends so completely<br />
That he even pretends<br />
The pain he really feels.</p>
<p>And those who read his writings,<br />
Sense well in the pain they read,<br />
Not his two but only<br />
The one they lack.</p>
<p>And so on its tracks it goes,<br />
Rotating to direct reason,<br />
This wind-up train<br />
We call the heart.</p>
<p>—Marilyn Scarantino Jones</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a feigner.<br />
So completely does he feign<br />
that the pain he truly feels<br />
he even feigns as pain.</p>
<p>And those who read his writings<br />
will feel the printed pain,<br />
not the two that he has suffered<br />
but the one that they must feign.</p>
<p>And so around its trackage<br />
the little clockwork train<br />
we call the heart, goes spinning<br />
to entertain the brain.</p>
<p>—Jean R. Longland</p>
<p>&quot;Self-Analysis&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a forger who<br />
Forges so completely that<br />
He forges even the feeling<br />
He feels truly as pain</p>
<p>And those who read his poems<br />
Feel absolutely, not his two<br />
Separate pains, but only the<br />
Pain that they do not feel</p>
<p>And thus, diverting the<br />
Understanding, the wind-up<br />
Train we call the heart<br />
Runs along its track.</p>
<p>—George Monteiro</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsicografia&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a forger.<br />
He forges so thoroughly<br />
That he even forges the pain<br />
He really feels as pain</p>
<p>Those who read what he writes<br />
Feel truly, reading pain,<br />
Not the two he had, but only<br />
The one they do not have.</p>
<p>And thus along the rails,<br />
To stall the reason,<br />
Runs that wind-up train<br />
They call the heart.</p>
<p>—George Monteiro</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychograph&quot;</p>
<p>Poets are liars.<br />
They lie so completely<br />
That they make up pain<br />
Even when they're hurting.</p>
<p>Readers of poetry<br />
Can know this pain,<br />
Not the real ones of course,<br />
But the imagined ones.</p>
<p>And on the train rails<br />
Huffing, fooling the head<br />
This little toy engine<br />
We call the heart.</p>
<p>—James Parr</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is an inventor.<br />
He invents so completely<br />
That he succeeds in inventing<br />
That the pain he really feels is pain.</p>
<p>And those who read what he writes<br />
Really feel in the pain they have read,<br />
Not the two which he felt,<br />
But only the one they do not have.</p>
<p>And thus in the wheel ruts<br />
There goes round and round, diverting Reason<br />
That clockwork toy train<br />
Which is called heart.</p>
<p>—F.E.G. Quintanilha</p>
<p>&quot;Self-Analysis&quot;</p>
<p>The poet's good at pretending,<br />
Such a master of the art<br />
He even manages to pretend<br />
The pain he really feels is pain</p>
<p>And those who read his written words<br />
Feel, as they read of pain<br />
Not the two kinds that were his<br />
But only the kind that's not theirs.</p>
<p>And so around its little track,<br />
To entertain the mind,<br />
Runs that clockwork train of ours,<br />
The thing we call the heart.</p>
<p>—Peter Rickard</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychogram&quot;</p>
<p>The poet is a feigner<br />
his feiging so complete<br />
that he comes to feign a grief<br />
in the grief he really feels.</p>
<p>And those who read what he writes<br />
sense well in the grief that the read<br />
not the two griefs he has suffered<br />
but only the one they do not feel.</p>
<p>And so on its wheeltracks turns,<br />
turns and amuses the thought,<br />
that mechanical train<br />
which is called the heart.</p>
<p>—Raymond Sayers</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsychography&quot;</p>
<p>Poets pretend<br />
They pretend so well<br />
They even pretend<br />
They suffer what they suffer.</p>
<p>But their readers feel<br />
Nor the pain that pretends<br />
Nor the pain that is<br />
But only their own that isn't real.</p>
<p>And so upon toy rails<br />
Circling reason like an art<br />
Runs round the model train<br />
That's known by the name of heart.</p>
<p>—Martin Seymour-Smith</p>
